      Users are able to draw a picture on the screen with the use of their webcam and fingers. The colors available are limited, but users can blend colors together to create their own! Think of it like finger-paitning, and how you mix colors together there.
    </div>
    <div class="project_container">
      <div class="project"> <h3> Drawing </h3> </div>
      <img src="../../Images/drawing.png" style="width:45%"> <br>
      This is the main use of this project, which tracks your index finger using your webcam and allows a user to draw on the canvas to "paint" their own pictures.
      <br>
      <div class="project"> <h3> Changing Size / Color </h3> </div>
      <img src="../../Images/changing_size.png" style="width:45%"> <img src="../../Images/changing_color.png" style="width:45%"> <br>
      By holding up both the index and the middle finger, a user is able to enter "selection mode," where they can choose a different color along the top banner, or a different size on the right of the bottom banner. The user's current brush settings and modeled in real-time via the bubble next to the current selection text.
      <br>
      <div class="project"> <h3> Blending Colors </h3> </div>
      <img src="../../Images/blending.png" style="width:45%"> <br>
      A user is able to blend colors together by drawing on top of a pre-existing color with a different one. This will "smear" the colors together, just like finger painting in real life, and will allow a user to make new colors that aren't accessible from the top bar (like purple, in the example above)
      <br>
      I find it easiest to blend by first painting one color with a larger brush size, then switching to a smaller brush size while trying to actually blend with the second color.
      <br>
      <div class="project"> <h3> Erasing </h3> </div>
      <img src="../../Images/erasing.png" style="width:45%"> <br>
      Finally, a user can erase parts of their drawing by selecting the eraser on the left of the bottom banner, then using their index finger just like with drawing. The current brush selection will be hollow to reflect this.
      <br>
      <div class="project"> <h3> Final Design </h3> </div>
      <img src="../../Images/final_drawing.png" style="width:45%"><br>
      By using all these tools, you can create some "beautiful" drawings, such as the one I made above! Have fun.
