      <div>
        Hello! My name is Nicholas (Nick), and I am a first-year graduate student at UC Irvine obtaining my Master's in Statistics.
      </div>
      <div>
        I am a graduate from Purdue Unviersity with a dual major in Computer Science and Applied Statistics. My career goals are to be able to implement what I learn in Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing models in the space industry, as I have previously interned at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for three summers working on CV models with satellite imagery.
      </div>
      <div>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading science-fiction novels, listening to music, going to the gym, or hanging out with my friends. I have also been trying to embark on <a href="../drinks">my mixology journey</a> recently! The rest of this page is my comprehensive resume, but for more short blurbs about my life, check out my <a href="blog">blog</a> page.
