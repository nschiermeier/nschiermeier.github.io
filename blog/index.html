     <h2>Blog</h2>
    </header>

    <div>
      I think I may start posting little updates here about my schoolwork. There may also be occasional updates about my personal life. I think that this might be a way that will help me study, and will also be a way I can just post about myself.
    </div>
    <div class="blog-container">
      <h1> The Nlog </h1>

      <p>Updates on my life! Mostly class re-caps as a way to help me study, but could include other stories as well. Think like a Blog, but more Nick!</p>

        <h2> Exploring Blogs </h2>
        <p class="snippet">
          Trying out creating a blog post and messing with formatting and things. Think of this one as the "Meta Blog."
        </p>
        <div class="full-post">
          <p>
            This is where the text of a full post would go! This would be a more detailed explanation than the quick snippet seen before. I would add details here about whatever the post is.
          </p>
        </div>
        <span class="read-more"> Read More ↓</span>
      </div>

    </div>

    <script>
      // toggle "Read More" content
      document.querySelectorAll(".read-more").forEach(button => {
        button.addEventListener("click", () => {
          const post = button.previousElementSibling;
          post.classList.toggle("open");
          button.textContent = post.classList.contains("open")
            ? "Read less ↑"
            : "Read more ↓";
        });
