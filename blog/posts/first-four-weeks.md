### Week 0

Yes, this story starts at Week 0. School started on Thursday, September 25th, where I had two of my classes. 
The first class was STATS 210, which is titled "Statistical Methods I: Linear Models". This class is an applied stats course, meaning we learn how to interpret data and use coding software such as R.
This class is similar to STAT 525 which I took at Purdue last year, so it is mostly a recap class for me, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it can be good to have a refresher as I adjust to grad school.

The next class I had was STATS 280, which is a seminar class where researchers from other places come in to give a brief lecture on their work. The point of this class is to expand my network and exposure to research. The first seminar was abit different however, and it was more of a "State of the Union" speech by our department chair.
