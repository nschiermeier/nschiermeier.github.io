### Week 0

Yes, this story starts at Week 0. School started on Thursday, September 25th, where I had two of my classes. 
The first class was STATS 210, which is titled "Statistical Methods I: Linear Models". This class is an applied stats course, meaning we learn how to interpret data and use coding software such as R.
This class is similar to STAT 525 which I took at Purdue last year, so it is mostly a recap class for me, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it can be good to have a refresher as I adjust to grad school.

The next class I had was STATS 280, which is a seminar class where researchers from other places come in to give a brief lecture on their work. The point of this class is to expand my network and exposure to research. The first seminar was abit different however, and it was more of a "State of the Union" speech by our department chair. 

### Week 1

On Monday of Week 1, I had STATS 200A, "Intermediate Probability and Statistical Theory", which is an intro probability course. This class is also similar to a class I have taken before, though the one I took was in sophomore year and at an undergraduate level, so though it is a "recap" course, there are a lot of things I haven't thought of in a very long time, so it might take some extra time and effort to remember all the key aspects of this class. 

After that I had STATS 295 which is a special topics course in Clinical Trials. This class seems interesting and is based on giving a presentation to the class, as well as discussing one other peer's presentation. My presentation date isn't until December, so I'll have time to prepare. The topic I chose was reinforcement learning in a contextualized-bandit approach, and though I'm not entirely sure what that means, the abstract sounded interesting so I decided to choose that one.

My final class is one I'm just auditing, STATS 270, titled "Stochastic Processes."
I decided to audit this class because I understand that stochastic processes are a very important part of statistics, though I didn't want to overload my schedule in my first quarter. This class appears to be the most interesting out of the bunch, though the professor moves at a very quick pace, so it can be somewhat hard to keep up with.

This is just a stream of conscious, but I'm not entirely sure how I want to structure these blogs. I want them to be a kind of weekly recap, but I don't know _how_ I want that to happen. I don't think I necessarily want to do a day-by-day type thing, but maybe just at the end of each week I'll upload and have the headers be the classes? I think that sounds good for me. This first one will be a little off though, because it is a recap of the last 4 weeks, so I think each week I'll just have a little paragraph or something. Not entirely sure...

Because of this, this post might also take a while to write. I have to remember everything and go bakc through my notes, so it mightt take a bit to fully finish. Luckily my midterms are right around now, so maybe while reviewing I will type up what I learned. Also, probably no pictures for this one, just due to the nature of it being so long and different already. I hope to incorporate pictures into the future entries, however.
