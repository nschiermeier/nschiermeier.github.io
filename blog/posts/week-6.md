Okay, I'm finding that it is kind of difficult to keep up with these blog posts... I've just now finished week 4, and am skipping week 5 to immediately go to week 6. Luckily this week should be short, as two of the classes had midterms in them, so there isn't a lot of lecture material to upload here.



\### STATS 200A



This class has my second midterm of the quarter this week! So there is only one lecture to go over, and on top of that, it's just finishing off Poison Processes, which I've already covered in other STATS 270 Lectures from earlier weeks. We went over independent Poisson processes, showing how the independence is similar to that of probabilities. The sum of two Poisson processes, N(t) = N<sub>A</sub>(t) + N<sub>B</sub>(t) ~ Poisson (λ<sub>A</sub> + λ<sub>B</sub>).



We started to go over something new, which are Multivariate Random Variables. These are multiple r.v.s that have a joint cdf or a joint pdf, which is a combined cdf or pdf for all the r.v.s present. There are a few propositions from this, those being the Law of Total PRobability, which allows you to find a specific probability by marginalizing (that is, either summing if discrete or integrating if continuous) over all the other variables. The other proposition is conditional probabilities, which hold similarly to how they do in the single random variable case. 



We ended by going over Independence of Multivariate r.v.s, which is similar to the univariate case, but now it would be: f<sub>X,Y</sub>(x,y) = f<sub>X</sub>(x)\\\*f<sub>Y</sub>(y). You have to be careful here, because two r.v.s are not independent if the bounds of one of them rely on the other. This would make them dependent.
