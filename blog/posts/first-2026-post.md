Happy New Years! You might've noticed that all my posts are now gone! That is because they have been moved to an archived page (see the top of the blog for the link). The archiving is done via a tag so I don't have to move files every time I want to archive (which will be at the start of every school quarter)
I've made some other (quite necessary) changed to the blog too. I think one of the things that kept me from updating it was because it took so LONG to type anything out, since I was doing it in markdown. I've added MathJax to my website's blog page now, so I should be able to easily use LaTeX when typing, which should help both me as the writer as well as the reader immensely.
(Would you believe me if I said it only took like 15 minutes to do... and I was just lazy the whole fall quarter?)
I also downloaded Notepad++ to write the blogs on. I prefer coding in vim (like a real programmer...) but writing the blogs and markdown in there was super annoying. So hopefully this will lead me to writing the blogs on time.

## Winter Break Recap

### Projects & Goals
My goals for winter break were to finish writing all the Fall Quarter weekly recaps, Update my website to add LaTeX and the blog archive page, and make significant progress on my Terrain Procedural Generation Visualizer project.
Out of all of these goals, the only one I finished was beating the story mode in Kirby Air Riders for the Nintendo Switch 2. Oh, I guess that wasn't one of the goals...
But as you can see, I _did_ add the archive page and LaTeX! I haven't tested it yet, so let's see if this works: $\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{i}{i+1}$. 

I did do a little work on the TPGV project, but it was kind of lame, just making a dictionary that can be updated with other biomes. It sucks because I did really want to work on this project, but I just felt lazy and wanted to take my winter break to rest, so I didn't work on the other projects much...

I did however go to the gym consintently over winter break. I just used the small gym in my neighborhood since I didn't want to pay the ludicrous fees for just one month at an actual gym, so I didn't have access to as much as I usually do, but something is better than nothing in this case.

I also wanted to read a lot, as I'm in the middle of the Foundation Trilogy and was hoping to get close to finishing. The good news here is I unlocked most of the machines and characters in Kirby Air Riders! Oh wait, again, that was not the goal. Can you tell what I really spent my break doing yet? Maybe I reuse this joke one more time to really hammer it in? (I did actually end up reading a bit towards the end of the break, but not as much as I wanted to.)

A less serious goal but still one I had set out for myself, I finally ended up getting the "One Shot" achievement in the game One Shot. I also finally beat the game Stray after having it for 2 years but never playing it.

### Personal

I spent a lot of time hanging out with my friends, girlfriend, and family this break. Some highlights include going to the casino with my friends (I lost all $20 I came with...), going Christmas light watching with my mom and girlfriend, going to a cafe with my mom to read, and a New Years Party with all my closest friends from home, followed by a nice New Years brunch the next morning. I thought there was going to be more to write here, but unless I go into detail about all these activities, I guess I'll just leave it at this. Hopefully blogs after this will be coming out weekly and look better than they have. See you all after the first week of Winter Quarter 2026!
